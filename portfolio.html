    <h2>ENPH 353 Robot Summer</h2>
    <p> Over the course of the summer of 2022 me and a team of 3 other students created a robot for the notorious ENPH 353 'robot' summer course. 
        The robot was designed to complete a series of tasks like picking up plastic 'idols' while avoiding obstacles, all while competing against the other teams in the class.
        Our robot was one of only 2 teams in the whole class able to complete the whole course and score the maximum number of points due to our unconventional control system which eschewed the expected linefollowing strategy to instead navigate using an IMU and dead reckoning.
