### Overview
Designed and built a competitive robot for Engineering Physics 'Robot Summer' competition featuring advanced navigation and sensing capabilities.

### Technical Details
- Implemented IMU-based navigation with PID control
- Developed digital signal processing for IR beacon tracking
- Created complete mechanical and electrical systems

### Technologies Used
- STM-32 microcontroller programming
- CAD software for mechanical design
- Designing and soldering custom prototype circuits

### Results & Impact
Became one of only teams in the class to score full points in competition. Ultimately scored lower than expected due to electrical failure early in the competition.
