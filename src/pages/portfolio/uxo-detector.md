### Overview
Built a Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Survey device for UXO detection using Geophysical Inversion techniques as a part of my Engineering Physics Capstone project. The detector used a custom coil system to magnetically excite the ground and embedded conductive objects and measured the response to determine the location and size of buried objects and the ground parameters. Work was done in collaboration with UBC Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.

### Technical Details
- Designed and manufactured custom magnetic coil system and mounting hardware
- Developed digital signal processing for processing output data
- Designed electrical systems for driving transmitter coil
- Utilized MATLAB and SimPEG software to develop a theoretical model of system behavior
- Used geophysical inversion techniques to infer ground parameters from magnetic measurements
- Trained novel AI classifier on synthetic data to detect presence of UXO-like objects in the field

### Technologies Used
- MATLAB simulation software
- CAD software for mechanical design
- Designing and soldering custom prototype circuits
- Geophysical inversion techniques for data analysis
- Python for data processing and analysis
- PyTorch for training machine learning models
