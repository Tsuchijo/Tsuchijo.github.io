## Introduction

This is a sample blog post demonstrating the rich markdown formatting capabilities of our 11ty-powered blog. You can write in simple markdown and it will be beautifully rendered with your existing site styling.

## Rich Content Support

### Images

You can easily embed images with captions:

![Photonic system diagram](../../pictures/system-diffusion.png){.center}

### Videos

Videos are also supported (though this is a placeholder):

<video controls>
  <source src="/gifs/video_with_audio_4.gif" type="video/gif">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Code Blocks

Here's some Python code with syntax highlighting:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def photonic_simulation(wavelength, refractive_index):
    """
    Simulate light propagation in a photonic crystal
    """
    k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength
    return k * refractive_index

# Example usage
wavelengths = np.linspace(400, 800, 100)  # nm
results = [photonic_simulation(w, 1.45) for w in wavelengths]

plt.plot(wavelengths, results)
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
plt.ylabel('Wave vector')
plt.title('Photonic Crystal Dispersion')
plt.show()
```

### Mathematical Expressions

You can include inline code like `numpy.array()` or `tensorflow.keras.Model()` easily.

### Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

This quote resonates with my approach to combining machine learning with photonics research.

### Lists and Structure

Here are some key areas I'm exploring:

1. **Neural networks for photonic design**
   - Optimization of waveguide structures
   - Inverse design problems
   - Real-time parameter tuning

2. **Signal processing applications**
   - Pattern recognition in optical signals
   - Noise reduction algorithms
   - Adaptive filtering techniques

3. **Future directions**
   - Integration with quantum photonics
   - Edge computing applications
   - Sustainable photonic systems

### Footnotes and Citations

Machine learning has revolutionized many fields[^1], and photonics is no exception. Recent advances in deep learning[^2] have opened new possibilities for optical system design.

The intersection of these fields presents unique challenges and opportunities[^3].

## Conclusion

This blog setup allows for rich, academic-style writing with beautiful formatting that matches your existing site design. The markdown format makes writing posts simple and enjoyable.
